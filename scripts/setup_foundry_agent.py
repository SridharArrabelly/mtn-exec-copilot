"""Provision (or update) the MTN Foundry agent used by the Voice Live backend.

This script creates a new version of a Microsoft Foundry agent (e.g.
``MtnAvatarAgent``) wired with two tools:

* **Azure AI Search** - internal index of past MTN executive meetings.
* **Grounding with Bing Custom Search** - single-shot open-web grounding
  restricted to a curated allow-list (configured server-side as a Bing Custom
  Search "configuration"). Provides hard source restriction rather than a soft
  ``site:`` hint, which makes the avatar's external answers safer to trust.

The agent's system prompt, model, and tool wiring live here; the runtime
backend (``backend/``) only references the agent by ``AGENT_NAME`` /
``AGENT_PROJECT_NAME`` and lets Foundry resolve the rest server-side.

The agent runs on ``gpt-4.1-mini`` + Grounding-with-Bing-Custom-Search: the
validated voice config (single grounded round-trip, no web_search fan-out).

Run ``scripts/test_foundry_agent.py`` after provisioning to smoke-test the
agent end-to-end.

Required environment variables (see ``.env.example``):
    PROJECT_ENDPOINT          Foundry project endpoint
                              (https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>)
    SEARCH_CONNECTION_NAME    Name of the Azure AI Search connection in the project
    SEARCH_INDEX_NAME         Azure AI Search index to expose to the agent
    AGENT_NAME                Name of the Foundry agent to create / version (e.g. ``MtnAvatarAgent``)
    AGENT_MODEL               Model deployment name to bind to the agent (e.g. ``gpt-4.1-mini``)
    BING_CONNECTION_NAME      Name of the Grounding-with-Bing-Custom-Search connection in the project
    BING_CUSTOM_CONFIG_NAME   Bing Custom Search configuration (instance) name — the curated
                              allow-list of sites that the tool is restricted to.

Auth: uses ``DefaultAzureCredential`` - run ``az login`` first.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/setup_foundry_agent.py

# Two prompt files live under prompts/agent/:
#   * instructions-nonreasoning.md — tuned for gpt-4.x / gpt-4o (fast, literal).
#     Hard rules ("EXACTLY ONE tool per turn"), HARD ANTI-RULE block,
#     exhaustive "X → tool" examples. These models do what the prompt says,
#     no more, no less, so the tool-selection contract is stated as hard
#     rules rather than "use judgement".
#   * instructions-reasoning.md — tuned for o-series / gpt-5 (deliberate,
#     multi-step). Softer principles, allows up to 3 tool calls per turn,
#     one refined follow-up search, no exhaustive anti-rule list. These
#     models can infer "MTN's own plans live in our minutes, not on the
#     web" from a short principle.
#
# Both share: voice-first output rules (no URLs / no markdown / ≤70 words),
# the silent meeting catalogue contract, and the bing_custom_search query
# style by intent (MTN corporate / telecom industry / share price).
#
# The external tool is `bing_custom_search` (a grounded round-trip
# restricted to a curated, server-side domain allow-list) rather than
# `web_search` — the latter fans out into many calls and bloats context.
#
# The variant is selected at create_agent() time from settings["agent_model"]
# via _model_supports_reasoning() — same predicate that gates the
# reasoning.effort parameter, so the prompt and the model capability stay
# in lock-step.
