# Avatar Forge — Microsoft Teams app (Phase 1, scope 1A)

This folder packages the Avatar Forge web app as an **anonymous Microsoft Teams
personal tab**. Scope **1A** is a **prototype** with one goal: **make it run in Teams
via sideload, with no Teams-admin access required.**

- Personal-scope **static tab** that embeds the existing web UI (mic + WebRTC avatar).
- **No SSO** and **no org/admin publishing** — those are a later phase you'll drive
  from the Teams admin center once the prototype works.
- Additive only: a templated manifest, two icons, a build script, a no-op-unless-in-Teams
  frontend init (`frontend/teams.js`), and one `frame-ancestors` CSP header in the backend.

> The same package built here is reused unchanged when you later publish it through the
> admin center — so the manifest stays templated and the zip stays valid (manifest + 2
> icons at the archive root).

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `manifest.template.json` | Teams manifest (schema v1.17) with `{{HOSTNAME}}`, `{{VERSION}}`, `{{APP_ID}}` placeholders. |
| `icons/color.png` | 192×192 color app icon. |
| `icons/outline.png` | 32×32 transparent outline icon (Teams recolors it). |
| `build_package.py` | Stdlib-only script that renders the manifest and zips a sideloadable package. |
| `build/avatar-forge-teams.zip` | Build output (git-ignored). |

## Build the package

You need the **live HTTPS hostname** of the deployed app — the bare host of your
Azure Container App, e.g. `avatar-forge.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io` (no
`https://`, no path, no port).

```bash
uv run python teams/build_package.py --hostname <your-app>.azurecontainerapps.io
```

For the **current deployment** the bare host is
`ca-mtn-agent-forge-hz3cp52lid6xq.whitedune-5a2336c6.swedencentral.azurecontainerapps.io`,
so the exact rebuild command is:

```bash
uv run python teams/build_package.py \
  --hostname ca-mtn-agent-forge-hz3cp52lid6xq.whitedune-5a2336c6.swedencentral.azurecontainerapps.io
```

> **Rebuild after a redeploy:** the hostname only changes if the Container App is
> recreated (a fresh `azd up` into a new environment). A normal `azd deploy` /
> image push keeps the same host, so the existing `avatar-forge-teams.zip` stays
> valid and you do **not** need to rebuild or re-sideload. Rebuild only when the
> host changes — then re-run the command above and re-upload the new zip.

Optional flags (env var equivalents in parentheses):

- `--version` (`TEAMS_APP_VERSION`) — manifest version, default `1.0.0`.
- `--app-id` (`TEAMS_APP_ID`) — stable app GUID. If omitted, a deterministic GUID is
  derived from the hostname so rebuilds produce the same id.

Output: `teams/build/avatar-forge-teams.zip` containing `manifest.json`,
`color.png`, and `outline.png` at the archive root.

## Run it in Teams (no admin access needed)

You do **not** need to publish to an org catalog. Two sideload routes — try A first; if
your tenant has custom-app upload disabled, use B.

### Route A — Upload a custom app (personal scope)

1. In Teams, go to **Apps → Manage your apps → Upload an app → Upload a custom app**.
2. Select `teams/build/avatar-forge-teams.zip`.
3. Add the app; open the **Avatar** personal tab.
4. When prompted, **allow microphone** (and camera if requested) for the tab.

> ⚠️ Even this basic, personal sideload can be blocked: the **"Upload a custom app"**
> option only appears if the tenant policy *Allow uploading custom apps* is enabled. If you
> don't see it, you're not doing anything wrong — use Route B instead.

### Route B — Teams Developer Portal "Preview in Teams" (admin-free fallback)

The Developer Portal lets you preview a sideloaded app without the upload-custom-app
policy, and is the recommended no-admin path for this prototype.

1. Open the **Teams Developer Portal** — <https://dev.teams.microsoft.com> (also available
   as the **Developer Portal** app inside Teams).
2. **Apps → Import app** and select `teams/build/avatar-forge-teams.zip`.
3. Open the imported app and click **Preview in Teams** (top right). Teams opens and adds
   the app for you.
4. Open the **Avatar** personal tab and **allow microphone** (and camera if requested).

If neither route is available, the last admin-free option is to **add the app to a team
you own** (some tenants allow app uploads scoped to a team even when personal upload is
off) — but for this prototype Route B is the simplest.

## Validation checklist (run in Teams **web** AND **desktop**)

- [ ] The tab loads the avatar UI over HTTPS (no blank frame / framing error).
- [ ] Microphone permission prompt appears and, once granted, `getUserMedia` succeeds.
- [ ] The WebRTC avatar **video** renders and the avatar **speaks** (audio out).
- [ ] Talking to the avatar works end-to-end (the WSS voice socket connects).
- [ ] Switching the Teams theme (light ↔ dark) updates the app theme live.
- [ ] The standalone app (`uv run avatar-forge`, port 3000) is unchanged — the Teams
      SDK is never loaded outside Teams.

If the avatar video or mic fails inside Teams, that is the gating risk for 1A — capture
the client (web/desktop), the console errors, and the permission state, and report back
before proceeding.

## How the in-Teams detection works

`frontend/teams.js` activates only when the page is inside Teams — detected via the
`?inTeams=1` query param that the manifest's `contentUrl` carries, with a framed-window
fallback. Outside Teams it returns immediately and the Teams JS SDK is never fetched, so
the standalone experience is byte-for-byte the same. Inside Teams it initializes the SDK
and mirrors the host theme into the app's existing `applyTheme()` hook.

## Embedding header

The backend sends a single response header so the Teams clients can frame the app:

```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' \
  https://teams.microsoft.com https://*.teams.microsoft.com \
  https://teams.live.com https://*.teams.live.com \
  https://*.skype.com
```

Only `frame-ancestors` is set on purpose — a full CSP (`script-src`/`connect-src`/
`media-src`) would break inline JS, the WSS voice socket, and WebRTC.

## Deferred to a later phase (not in this prototype)

- Publishing through the **Teams admin center** (org catalog / targeted release / admin
  approval) — you'll do this from the admin portal once the sideloaded prototype works.
  The package built here is reused unchanged for that step.
- Real privacy-policy and terms-of-use pages (the manifest currently points at repo pages,
  which is fine for sideload).

# Phase 2a — Conversational bot (issue #53)

Phase 2a adds an **installable, @mentionable bot** to the **same Teams app package** (the
manifest now carries both a `staticTabs` entry **and** a `bots` entry — one app, two
surfaces). The bot answers questions using the **same Foundry agent** the voice avatar
uses (Azure AI Search RAG + Bing grounding), returns answers as Adaptive Cards with
sources, and can deep-link back into the Phase 1 tab for the live avatar.

It is **additive**: the Phase 1 tab and the standalone web app are unchanged, and no Node
toolchain is introduced. The bot is hosted **inside the existing FastAPI app** (new
`POST /api/messages` route) using the **Microsoft 365 Agents SDK** (`microsoft-agents-*`,
FastAPI adapter), so it ships in the same Container App — the messaging endpoint is just
the existing ACA HTTPS URL + `/api/messages`.

## What changed

| Area | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `teams/manifest.template.json` | Added a `bots` entry (`personal` + `team` + `groupchat` scopes), a `commandLists`, a `{{BOT_ID}}` placeholder, and `token.botframework.com` to `validDomains`. The static tab is untouched. |
| `teams/build_package.py` | New `--bot-id` / `TEAMS_BOT_ID` input fills `{{BOT_ID}}`. The zip stays flat (manifest + 2 icons). |
| `backend/bot/` | The bot: SDK app + `/api/messages` route (`app.py`), Foundry-agent bridge (`agent_runtime.py`), Adaptive Card + deep link (`cards.py`). |
| `backend/main.py` | Mounts the bot router before the static SPA; closes the agent client on shutdown. |
| `infra/` | New `modules/botService.bicep` (Azure Bot + Teams channel), conditional on a bot app id; container env + secret wiring. |

## Identity model (read this first)

The bot needs a **bot identity** = an **Entra app registration** (client id + secret),
registered as an **Azure Bot** resource with the **Teams channel** enabled. This is
**separate** from the backend's managed identity (which still reaches Foundry/Search) and
**separate** from user SSO (deferred — see below).

- **Azure Bot + Teams channel + container wiring** are created by `infra/` when you supply
  the bot app id/secret — **no Teams admin access required** (these are *Azure* RBAC
  actions in your subscription).
- **User SSO is deferred** (Phase 2a ships with bot-framework identity only). The bot does
  not yet exchange a user token, so it does not need `webApplicationInfo` in the manifest
  for the MVP. Adding SSO later requires an exposed API scope + `webApplicationInfo` +
  token-exchange handling.

## Steps you must do yourself (portal / CLI)

These cannot be done from this repo because they create an **app registration** (an
identity object), which lives outside the resource-group deployment:

1. **Create the bot's Entra app registration** (single-tenant is simplest):
   ```bash
   az ad app create --display-name "Avatar Forge Bot" --sign-in-audience AzureADMyOrg
   # note the appId (this is your BOT app id), then add a client secret:
   az ad app credential reset --id <bot-app-id> --append
   # note the returned password (client secret)
   ```
2. **Give azd the bot values** (the infra wires the Azure Bot + container env from these):
   ```bash
   azd env set BOT_APP_ID <bot-app-id>
   azd env set BOT_APP_PASSWORD <bot-client-secret>   # stored as an ACA secret
   azd env set TEAMS_APP_ID <teams-app-id>            # same id you build the package with
   ```
   > These map to the `botAppId` / `botAppPassword` / `teamsAppId` Bicep params. If
   > `BOT_APP_ID` is unset, the bot infra is skipped entirely and the deploy behaves
   > exactly as Phase 1.
3. **Provision + deploy**: `azd up` (or `azd provision` then `azd deploy`). This creates
   the Azure Bot, enables the Teams channel, and sets the messaging endpoint to
   `https://<aca-host>/api/messages`. The endpoint is also emitted as the
   `BOT_MESSAGING_ENDPOINT` output.

## Build the package (with the bot id)

The manifest now requires a bot id, so pass `--bot-id` (the bot app id from step 1):

```bash
uv run python teams/build_package.py \
  --hostname <your-app>.azurecontainerapps.io \
  --bot-id <bot-app-id>
```

`--app-id` / `TEAMS_APP_ID` behaves as before (deterministic from the hostname if
omitted). Output is the same flat `teams/build/avatar-forge-teams.zip`. **Sideload it
exactly as in Phase 1** (Route A or Route B above) — the same package now installs both
the tab and the bot.

## Validate the bot (web AND desktop)

- [ ] **Personal chat:** open the bot, send a question, get an answer **with a Sources
      list** and an **"Open the live avatar"** button that launches the tab.
- [ ] **Group chat:** add the app, **@mention** the bot, get an answer (bots only see
      messages they're @mentioned in, in group/meeting chat).
- [ ] **Meeting chat:** add the app to a meeting, **@mention** the bot in the meeting chat,
      get an answer (chat-only — no in-call media yet; that's Phase 2b / #27).
- [ ] **Parity:** the same question asked to the bot and to the voice avatar returns
      consistent answers + citations (both go through the same Foundry agent).
- [ ] **No regressions:** the Phase 1 tab still loads and the standalone web app
      (`uv run avatar-forge`) is unchanged.

> The bot endpoint also answers `GET /api/messages` with `{"status":"ok"}` for a quick
> liveness check once deployed.

## Known gating risks

- **Turn latency:** a grounded answer can take several seconds. The bot sends a typing
  indicator and waits up to `BOT_RUN_TIMEOUT_S` (default 12s); if exceeded it returns a
  "still working" holding reply. A proactive "answer arrives later" flow is a planned
  enhancement, not in the MVP.
- **Conversational memory:** the MVP treats each turn statelessly. Multi-turn memory
  (threading via the Responses API) is wired but off by default to avoid cross-user
  context bleed in group/meeting chats.
- **SSO:** deferred — the bot does not yet know *who* asked. Add `webApplicationInfo` +
  token exchange in a follow-up if per-user identity is required.
