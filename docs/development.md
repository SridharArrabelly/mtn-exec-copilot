# Development (run it locally)

Get Avatar Forge running on your machine in a few minutes. You do **not** need Docker
or `azd` for local development — just `uv` and `az login`. For env vars see
[configuration.md](configuration.md); for Azure deployment see
[deployment.md](deployment.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- An active Azure account ([free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services))
- A **Microsoft Foundry** resource in a [Voice Live region](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live)
- A base chat model deployed in Foundry (e.g. `gpt-4.1` or `gpt-5`+) — the agent binds to it
- An [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal)
  service, added as a [connected resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/connections-add)
  in the Foundry project (its connection name → `SEARCH_CONNECTION_NAME`)

> **Avatar regions.** The avatar feature is available in: Southeast Asia, North Europe,
> West Europe, Sweden Central, South Central US, East US 2, West US 2.

## 1. Install uv (one-time)

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

`uv` creates the `.venv` and installs dependencies automatically the first time you run
the app.

## 2. Configure your environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in at least the required runtime vars (`AZURE_VOICELIVE_ENDPOINT`, `AGENT_NAME`,
`AGENT_PROJECT_NAME`, `PROJECT_ENDPOINT`) — the full reference is in
[configuration.md](configuration.md). On a dev laptop, also set
`AUTH_EXCLUDE_MANAGED_IDENTITY=true` to skip the slow IMDS probe (see [auth.md](auth.md)).

Authenticate (the Voice Live agent path requires Entra ID — no API key):

```bash
az login
```

## 3. Run the server

```bash
uv run avatar-forge
```

Or with uvicorn directly (auto-reload):

```bash
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --reload
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

> Set `DEVELOPER_MODE=true` in `.env` to expose the settings panel, live transcript,
> and per-event debug logging.

## Build the Azure AI Search index

The agent answers from your own documents via an Azure AI Search index. Use
[`scripts/setup_aisearch_index.py`](../scripts/setup_aisearch_index.py) to (re)create
the index and ingest content from [`data/`](../data/).

Supported file types (auto-detected, recursive): **`.docx`, `.pdf`, `.md`,
`.markdown`, `.txt`**. To add a format, register a reader in the `READERS` dict at the
top of the script.

What the script does each run:

1. **Discover** — walks `data/` recursively for registered extensions.
2. **Read** — extracts plain text per file type (`python-docx`, `pypdf`, raw read).
3. **Chunk** — overlapping windows of `CHUNK_SIZE` chars with `CHUNK_OVERLAP` overlap.
4. **Embed** — sends chunks to the Foundry Azure OpenAI route (`text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dims).
5. **Upload** — pushes chunks + vectors into the index, configured for **hybrid search**
   (BM25 + HNSW/cosine) with a **semantic configuration** (`default-semantic`) for L2 re-ranking.

This is a one-off bootstrap — the running app never re-ingests, it only queries.

Required roles for the signed-in user: **Search Index Data Contributor** + **Search
Service Contributor** on AI Search, and **Azure AI User** (or equivalent) on the
Foundry project with access to the embedding deployment.

```bash
uv run python scripts/setup_aisearch_index.py
# wipe + rebuild from scratch:
RECREATE_INDEX=true uv run python scripts/setup_aisearch_index.py
```

## Smoke-test the index

```bash
uv run python scripts/test_aisearch_query.py "what was discussed about dividends"
uv run python scripts/test_aisearch_query.py -k 3 "board chair election"
```

Issues a hybrid + semantic query and prints the top results with BM25/vector and
reranker scores.

## Smoke-test the live agent

```bash
uv run python scripts/test_foundry_agent.py
```

Exercises the registered Foundry agent end-to-end (tool calls + final answer) — useful
to confirm tool routing after editing prompts or switching `AGENT_MODEL`. The routing
test checklist + model-shootout results live in
[`prompts/agent/routing-test-questions.md`](../prompts/agent/routing-test-questions.md).

## (Re)register the Foundry agent

After editing the prompts in [`prompts/agent/`](../prompts/agent/) or changing
`AGENT_MODEL` / tool wiring, re-register the agent:

```bash
uv run python scripts/setup_foundry_agent.py
```

The script selects the prompt variant (reasoning vs non-reasoning) from `AGENT_MODEL`
and wires the AI Search + Grounding-with-Bing-Custom-Search tools. See
[`prompts/README.md`](../prompts/README.md) and
[architecture.md](architecture.md#tool-calling-accuracy).

## Docker (local) — not recommended

You do **not** need Docker to run locally. The `Dockerfile` exists so `azd` can build
the image during `azd up`/`azd deploy`. Running the image locally is discouraged: it
has no `az` CLI and no IMDS, so `DefaultAzureCredential` can't authenticate unless your
tenant allows service-principal secrets (`AZURE_TENANT_ID` / `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` /
`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`), which many tenants block. Use the host instructions above.

## Run inside Microsoft Teams

To run the same UI as a Teams personal tab (and the Phase 2a conversational bot),
follow [`teams/README.md`](../teams/README.md) — it covers building the package against
your deployed hostname, the admin-free sideload routes, the bot's Azure Bot / Entra
setup, and the validation checklist. The Teams integration is fully additive: the
standalone local experience above is byte-for-byte unchanged (the Teams JS SDK is never
loaded outside Teams).
