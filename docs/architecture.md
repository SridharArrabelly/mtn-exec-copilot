# Architecture

How Avatar Forge is put together: the server-side Voice Live bridge, the Foundry
agent it binds to, the tool-calling design that makes answers accurate, and the
frontend UX. For environment variables see [configuration.md](configuration.md);
for deploying it see [deployment.md](deployment.md).

```

**Key design.** The Python backend is a bridge between the browser and the Azure
Voice Live service. Voice Live binds the session to an existing **Microsoft Foundry
agent** via `agent_config = { agent_name, project_name }`. The agent (created once
with [`scripts/setup_foundry_agent.py`](../scripts/setup_foundry_agent.py)) owns the
system prompt, model selection, and tool wiring — an **Azure AI Search** index over
the document corpus plus **Grounding with Bing Custom Search** for live web facts
restricted to a curated domain allow-list. Voice Live handles speech-in/speech-out
and routes turns through the agent so tool calls resolve server-side in Foundry.

**All Voice Live SDK operations run on the server** (session creation, configuration,
audio forwarding, event processing). The browser only:

- captures the microphone → sends PCM16 audio over the WebSocket;
- plays back PCM16 audio received over the WebSocket;
- relays WebRTC signaling for the avatar video (SDP offer/answer through the backend)
  and renders the avatar via a direct WebRTC peer connection to Azure;
- (WebSocket video mode) receives fMP4 chunks for MediaSource Extensions playback.

The **Teams bot** (Phase 2a) is hosted inside the same FastAPI app as a `POST
/api/messages` route and reuses the same Foundry agent — see
[`teams/README.md`](../teams/README.md).

The **in-call audio participant** (Phase 2b, issue #27) reuses the same Voice Live +
Foundry pipeline for a *live Teams meeting*. Because ACS Call Automation has no
join-by-URL API, a browser page (`frontend/acs-join.html`) joins the meeting with the
ACS Calling Web SDK (anonymous, lobby-governed — no Teams admin, no server Node
toolchain) and hands the resulting `ServerCallId` to the server, which calls ACS
`connect_call(...)` with bidirectional MIXED audio over a server-hosted WebSocket
(`/ws/acs/audio`). [`backend/acs/bridge.py`](../backend/acs/bridge.py)'s
`AcsVoiceBridge` adapts that media socket onto the unchanged `VoiceSessionHandler`
(PCM16 in/out, wake-phrase turn-taking, barge-in). Audio-only by design, non-recording,
and fully opt-in behind `ACS_ENABLED` (every `/api/acs/*` route returns 503 when off).
See [`teams/README.md`](../teams/README.md#phase-2b--in-call-audio-participant-issue-27).

## Tool-calling accuracy

The avatar's usefulness hinges on calling the **right tool** per question: the Azure
AI Search index for internal questions, **Grounding with Bing Custom Search** for
live external facts from a curated allow-list (share price, competitor news), or
**both** for comparisons ("how does our revenue compare to what analysts expected?").

The original agent decided tools entirely on its own and reached only **~70%**
first-tool accuracy, frequently **fanning out** multiple external web calls (≈45% of
web turns), inflating latency and token cost. Adopting **Grounding with Bing Custom
Search** (a single hosted Bing call instead of an open-ended web tool) and pinning
the model lifted first-tool accuracy to **~93.5%** on the original `gpt-4.1-mini`
baseline and cut fan-out to ≈3%. The **current production model is `gpt-5.4` with
`AGENT_REASONING_EFFORT=none`**, which scores **30/30** on the routing harness
([`prompts/agent/routing-test-questions.md`](../prompts/agent/routing-test-questions.md))
with cleaner numeric synthesis; `gpt-5.4-mini` is a faster, cheaper fallback and
`gpt-4.1-mini` remains the documented baseline.

**The web tool.** The agent's only external tool is **`bing_custom_search`** — a
single grounded round-trip that returns curated snippets restricted to a server-side
domain allow-list (the "configuration" provisioned in the Bing Custom Search portal,
referenced by `BING_CUSTOM_CONFIG_NAME`). An open-ended web-search tool on
`gpt-4.1-mini` either fans out into many calls or bloats the context;
`bing_custom_search` resolves a turn in one call. It is wired via `BING_CONNECTION_NAME`
+ `BING_CUSTOM_CONFIG_NAME` when running `setup_foundry_agent.py`.

**The system prompt.** The provisioning script picks one of two prompt variants based
on `AGENT_MODEL`: [`instructions-nonreasoning.md`](../prompts/agent/instructions-nonreasoning.md)
for `gpt-4.x`/`gpt-4o` (literal, hard rules, one tool per turn) and
[`instructions-reasoning.md`](../prompts/agent/instructions-reasoning.md) for
o-series/`gpt-5` (softer principles, up to 3 tool calls per turn, refined follow-up
search allowed). Both share the voice-first output rules, the silent meeting-catalogue
contract, the intent-aware Bing query block, and the JSE-cents conversion rule. The
selector uses the same `_model_supports_reasoning()` predicate that gates
`reasoning.effort`, so prompt and model capability stay in lock-step. Full detail in
[`prompts/README.md`](../prompts/README.md).

## Meeting-catalogue injection

At session start the backend fetches a compact catalogue of every indexed meeting
(date + title) from AI Search and injects it as a system message. This lets the agent
answer "how many meetings / first / last / list them" with **no** search call, and
lets it phrase precise content searches using exact dates. The catalogue is cached
for `MEETING_CATALOG_TTL_S` (default 15 min). Code:
[`backend/voice/catalog.py`](../backend/voice/catalog.py).

## Frontend UX

The browser UI has two modes, selected by `DEVELOPER_MODE` and delivered to the
client through [`/api/config`](../backend/api/routes.py):

- **Normal mode** (production default, `DEVELOPER_MODE=false`) — a clean, avatar-only
  experience. The session auto-starts; the settings/transcript side panel is hidden.
- **Developer mode** (`DEVELOPER_MODE=true`) — exposes the settings panel, the live
  chat transcript, and per-event debug logging alongside the avatar.

### The avatar stage (normal mode)

Everything the end user sees is anchored to the avatar:

- **Avatar video** — the WebRTC (or WebSocket/MSE) photo or standard avatar.
- **Identity lockup** — top-left, a branding block with the avatar's **name** (bold)
  and an optional **tagline** (italic). The name comes from `AVATAR_DISPLAY_NAME`
  (the single branding knob, also used for the Teams bot) or is derived from the
  selected avatar model; the tagline is `AVATAR_TAGLINE` (empty hides it).
- **Bottom control row** — the **text composer** (when shown) fills the left; the
  **Stop button** and the **docked mic** cluster in the right corner. They share a
  height and scale with the avatar across screen sizes.
- **Text composer** *(host-aware)* — a "Type a message…" pill so users can type
  instead of (or alongside) talking. Reuses the existing text path (voice stays
  primary) and stays disabled until the session connects. Shown on the **web** app
  (default on, `ENABLE_TEXT_INPUT`); **always hidden inside Teams** — the frontend
  detects the Teams host (`isEmbeddedInTeams()`, mirroring `frontend/teams.js`) and
  suppresses it, because the bot chat tab has Teams' native compose box and the
  avatar tab is voice-first. Hidden in developer mode, which keeps its own input.
- **Stop button** *(`ENABLE_STOP_BUTTON`, default on)* — a small control beside the
  mic, always visible while the avatar is on screen: greyed when idle, red and
  actionable while the avatar speaks. Tapping it truncates the avatar mid-answer via
  the same interrupt path as voice barge-in (`response.cancel()` **and**
  `output_audio_buffer.clear()` server-side — see [below](#interrupt-truncation)).
- **Thinking indicator** — shows between the user's turn and the avatar's first
  words, with rotating captions and a failsafe timeout.
- **Connection & permission states** — a status pill (and toasts) surface connecting,
  mic blocked/denied, reconnecting, session ended, and avatar/transport errors.
- **Live captions** *(`ENABLE_CAPTIONS`, default off)* — a frosted subtitle band
  below the avatar mirroring the streamed transcript (and optionally the user's last
  utterance). Reuses the transcript stream — no extra model calls.
- **Speaking-state colour shift** — the avatar renders **grayscale while idle** and
  **shifts to full colour** while actually speaking. Driven by real-playback signals
  (the WebRTC data-channel `EVENT_TYPE_SWITCH_TO_SPEAKING`/`_IDLE` events plus an
  `AnalyserNode` on the live audio track), with a watchdog so it never sticks on.
- **Suggested prompts + onboarding hint** *(`ENABLE_SUGGESTED_PROMPTS`, default on)*
  — on first load, a one-line hint and 2–3 tappable example chips. The hint wording
  is derived from the *effective* composer state (so Teams never says "…or type…").

The captions, suggested-prompt, text-input, and stop-button features are additive and
individually configurable — see [configuration.md](configuration.md#avatar-ux-additive-frontend-features).
The UI is themeable via CSS custom properties and ships a **dark variant** following
the OS `prefers-color-scheme` (with an `applyTheme(light|dark|system)` hook); all
animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Interrupt / truncation

Voice barge-in works because the server VAD config in
[`backend/voice/builders.py`](../backend/voice/builders.py) (`interrupt_response`,
`auto_truncate`) truncates output audio when the user speaks. The **Stop button**
replicates this without speech: `backend/voice/handler.py`'s `interrupt()` calls both
`response.cancel()` (cancels in-flight generation) **and**
`connection.output_audio_buffer.clear()` (immediately truncates already-generated
audio the WebRTC avatar is still rendering). `response.cancel()` alone is a no-op once
a turn has finished generating but is still being spoken — the `output_audio_buffer.clear()`
call is what actually stops her.
