# Deployment (Azure)

Provision and deploy Avatar Forge to Azure with the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview)
(`azd`). One command provisions the infra, builds the image, and deploys the app.
For local development see [development.md](development.md); for env vars see
[configuration.md](configuration.md); for the Teams tab + bot see
[`teams/README.md`](../teams/README.md).

## Target topology

- **Azure Container Apps** (WebSockets-enabled, ingress port 3000, 1–3 replicas) — runs the app
- **Azure Container Registry** (Standard, admin disabled) — image registry
- **User-Assigned Managed Identity** — ACR pull + Foundry + Search access (no secrets in env)
- **Log Analytics + Application Insights** — observability
- **Azure AI Foundry** (account + project + model deployment) — created or BYO
- **Azure AI Search** (Basic, AAD auth) — created or BYO
- **Azure Bot + Teams channel** *(optional, Phase 2a)* — created only when a bot app id is supplied

## Prerequisites

- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd-install) (`azd`)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (for `az login`)
- An Azure subscription with **Owner** (or Contributor + User Access Administrator) —
  the template grants RBAC roles
- Docker Desktop **running** (the `Dockerfile` is built during `azd up`/`azd deploy`;
  you don't call `docker build`/`run` yourself — remote ACR build is also supported)

## Pre-deployment checks (run this first)

Two things have caused silent failures in past deployments:

1. **Voice Live is only available in a small set of regions** — `eastus2`,
   `swedencentral`, `southeastasia`, `centralindia`, `westus2`. Deploying the Foundry
   account elsewhere lets the WebSocket connect and the MI token succeed, then the
   server closes the socket within ~2s with no error event (surfaced as
   `SESSION_UPDATED event not received`).
2. **TTS Avatar is only available in** `eastus2`, `westus2`, `northeurope`,
   `westeurope`, `swedencentral`, `southeastasia`.

Run the preflight before `azd up`:

```bash
# All-in-one (Foundry in same region as everything else)
uv run python scripts/preflight.py --location <your-region>

# Split regions (app stack in southafricanorth, Foundry+VoiceLive in eastus2)
uv run python scripts/preflight.py --location southafricanorth --voicelive-location eastus2
```

If your primary `AZURE_LOCATION` is **not** a Voice Live region, set
`FOUNDRY_LOCATION` to one that is — the Foundry account+project (and the avatar voice
path) are created there while the rest of the stack stays in `AZURE_LOCATION`:

```bash
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION   southafricanorth
azd env set FOUNDRY_LOCATION eastus2
```

## Deploy (greenfield)

> **Load your documents first.** The `postprovision` hook indexes every `data/*.docx`
> into the freshly-created AI Search service. Drop your documents into
> [`data/`](../data/) **before** `azd up`; otherwise the index is empty and you must
> rerun `scripts/setup_aisearch_index.py` manually. BYO Search skips this.

```bash
# 1. Authenticate
az login
azd auth login

# 2. Initialise an azd environment
azd init

# 3. Provision infra + build + deploy app
#    azd prompts for: Subscription, Location, Environment name, Resource Group name
azd up
```

After `azd up` the URL of the running container app is printed (and stored as
`SERVICE_APP_URI` in the azd env).

## Bring-your-own Foundry / Search (brownfield)

The two big-ticket resources — **Azure AI Foundry** and **Azure AI Search** — can be
created fresh (default) or reused. Each has its own independent switch:

```bicep
// infra/main.bicep
var createFoundry = empty(foundryAccountName) || empty(foundryResourceGroup) || empty(foundryProjectEndpoint)
var createSearch  = empty(searchServiceName)  || empty(searchResourceGroup)
```

A resource is treated as BYO **only when its identifying env vars are set** (all three
`FOUNDRY_*` for Foundry, both `SEARCH_*` for Search) — otherwise the template
provisions a new one. The switches are independent: BYO Foundry while creating Search,
or vice versa.

### Full BYO walkthrough

```bash
# 1. Authenticate
az login
azd auth login

# 2. Initialise the azd environment
azd init     # prompts for env name (e.g. demo-dev)

# 3. Subscription / region / RG
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID     <sub-guid>
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION            eastus2
azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME rg-demo-dev

# 4. Point at the EXISTING Foundry account + project
azd env set FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT_NAME     your-foundry-prod
azd env set FOUNDRY_RESOURCE_GROUP   rg-shared-ai
azd env set FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT https://your-foundry-prod.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/avatar-forge

# 5. Point at the EXISTING AI Search service + index
azd env set SEARCH_SERVICE_NAME   your-search-prod
azd env set SEARCH_RESOURCE_GROUP rg-shared-ai
azd env set SEARCH_INDEX_NAME     your-existing-index-name

# 5b. (optional) BYO Application Insights
azd env set APPINSIGHTS_NAME           your-appi-prod
azd env set APPINSIGHTS_RESOURCE_GROUP rg-shared-observability

# (optional) Pin the agent / search / bing names the container reads at runtime
azd env set AGENT_NAME              MtnAvatarAgent
azd env set SEARCH_CONNECTION_NAME  aisearch-connection
azd env set BING_CONNECTION_NAME    groundingwithbingcustquraml
azd env set BING_CUSTOM_CONFIG_NAME mtn-avatar-search

# 6. Provision + deploy
azd up
```

### What gets created vs. skipped

| Resource | Created? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Resource Group | ✅ | From `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` |
| User-Assigned Managed Identity | ✅ | App-scoped identity |
| Log Analytics + App Insights | ✅ | Per-app observability (App Insights conditional if `APPINSIGHTS_NAME` set) |
| Azure Container Registry | ✅ | App's own ACR |
| Container Apps Environment + Container App | ✅ | The web app |
| **Foundry account + project + model deployment** | ❌ SKIPPED | Reuses BYO Foundry |
| **AI Search service + index** | ❌ SKIPPED | Reuses BYO Search |

You still get a self-contained RG (app, logs, ACR, identity) but **no duplicate
Foundry/Search**.

### Cross-RG RBAC (easy to miss)

Because BYO Foundry/Search live in a *different* resource group, the new managed
identity needs role assignments on those foreign resources. Bicep can't do this safely
(a deterministic role-assignment name collides with any pre-existing assignment for the
same principal+role+scope — Azure rejects it with `RoleAssignmentExists`). So the
grants are made idempotently by [`scripts/grant_byo_rbac.py`](../scripts/grant_byo_rbac.py),
invoked from the `postprovision` hook in [`azure.yaml`](../azure.yaml). It calls
`az role assignment create` and swallows duplicate errors, so re-running `azd up` is
always safe.

It grants the UAMI:

- **Cognitive Services User** + **Azure AI Developer** on the BYO Foundry account
- **Search Index Data Reader** + **Search Service Contributor** on the BYO Search service

When **both** are BYO, it also grants the existing Foundry project's system-assigned
identity **Search Index Data Contributor** + **Search Service Contributor** on the BYO
Search service so the agent's `azure_ai_search` tool can read the index at runtime.

> **Permissions:** the principal running `azd up` needs **User Access Administrator**
> (or **Owner**) on the foreign resource group(s) to stamp these assignments. This is
> the only extra permission vs. the all-new path.

### How the app finds BYO resources at runtime

[`infra/resources.bicep`](../infra/resources.bicep) picks the effective endpoints:

```bicep
var foundryEndpointEffective        = createFoundry ? foundry!.outputs.accountEndpoint : 'https://${existingFoundryAccountName}.services.ai.azure.com/'
var foundryProjectEndpointEffective = createFoundry ? foundry!.outputs.projectEndpoint : existingFoundryProjectEndpoint
var searchEndpointEffective         = createSearch  ? search!.outputs.endpoint         : 'https://${existingSearchServiceName}.search.windows.net/'
```

These flow into the container app as `AZURE_VOICELIVE_ENDPOINT`, `PROJECT_ENDPOINT`,
and `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` — the same env vars your local `.env` uses, so the backend
doesn't notice any difference between BYO and freshly-created resources.

### Mixed mode (BYO one, create the other)

Same flow, set only one BYO triplet. Example — BYO Foundry, fresh Search:

```bash
azd env set FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT_NAME     your-foundry-prod
azd env set FOUNDRY_RESOURCE_GROUP   rg-shared-ai
azd env set FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT https://your-foundry-prod.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/avatar-forge
# (no SEARCH_* — template creates a fresh Search service)
azd up
# Then populate the new index:
uv run python scripts/setup_aisearch_index.py
```

## Runtime config / model deployment overrides

The Bicep template accepts overrides via azd env vars — set before `azd provision`:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_NAME` | `AvatarAgent` | Foundry agent name the app calls |
| `AGENT_PROJECT_NAME` | `avatar-forge` | Foundry project name |
| `SEARCH_CONNECTION_NAME` | `aisearch-connection` | Foundry AI Search connection name |
| `SEARCH_INDEX_NAME` | `knowledge-index` | AI Search index name |
| `VOICELIVE_VOICE` | `en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural` | Default avatar voice |
| `MODEL_NAME` | `gpt-5.4` | OpenAI model to deploy in Foundry |
| `MODEL_VERSION` | `2026-03-05` | Model version (must match `MODEL_NAME`) |
| `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | `gpt-5.4` | Deployment name (used by the agent) |
| `MODEL_SKU_NAME` | `GlobalStandard` | Deployment SKU |
| `MODEL_CAPACITY` | `50` | TPM (thousands) capacity |

See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for the complete list, including the avatar,
UX, and Teams-bot variables.

## Post-deploy steps

For **greenfield** (template provisions Foundry + Search) the `postprovision` hook in
[`azure.yaml`](../azure.yaml) runs both setup scripts automatically:

- `scripts/setup_aisearch_index.py` — chunks + embeds every `data/*.docx` and builds
  the AI Search index. **Drop documents into `data/` BEFORE `azd up`** — otherwise the
  hook prints a warning and you must run it manually after adding files.
- `scripts/setup_foundry_agent.py` — registers the Foundry agent (`AGENT_NAME`) with
  the AI Search + Grounding-with-Bing-Custom-Search tools.

For **brownfield** (BYO) the hook skips both — your existing agent and index are reused.
Make sure your `AGENT_NAME` / `AGENT_PROJECT_NAME` / `SEARCH_CONNECTION_NAME` /
`SEARCH_INDEX_NAME` match what's actually in the BYO resources (override with
`azd env set` before `azd provision`).

You can always rerun them manually (point your local `.env` at the deployed endpoints
via `azd env get-values`):

```bash
uv run python scripts/setup_aisearch_index.py     # rebuild the index
uv run python scripts/setup_foundry_agent.py      # re-register the agent + tools
```

## Teams (tab + bot)

The deployed Container App HTTPS URL is both the Teams tab `contentUrl` and the bot's
messaging endpoint (`/api/messages`). Building the package, the Azure Bot registration,
sideloading, and the bot identity steps are all in [`teams/README.md`](../teams/README.md).
The bot infra is **opt-in**: if no bot app id is supplied, the deploy behaves exactly
like the tab-only Phase 1.
